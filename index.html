        <h2>Blog on Lions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Lions are at the top of the food chain, with no natural predators. They are often depicted in stories and films as majestic and strong. Simba, the Swahili word for lion, means “king,” “strong,” and “aggressive.” Similarly, in English, to describe someone as “lionhearted” means that they are courageous and brave. An African lion’s roar can be heard up to 5 miles (8 km) away!
        </p>
        <p>
            While lions are large, powerful cats, their numbers have declined dramatically in recent years. African lion numbers have plummeted by over 40% in the last three generations, largely as a result of habitat loss and conflicts with humans.

        <h2>The Fascinating World of Turtles</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Turtles are some of the most intriguing creatures on our planet. With their hard shells, slow movements, and ancient lineage, they have captured the curiosity of nature lovers for centuries. From tiny freshwater species to giant sea turtles, these reptiles are found all over the world, playing vital roles in their ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Turtles</h3>
        <p>There are more than 350 species of turtles, categorized mainly into three groups:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sea Turtles: Found in oceans, they are excellent swimmers with streamlined bodies and flippers. Some famous species include the Leatherback Turtle and the Green Sea Turtle.</li>
            <li>Freshwater Turtles: Living in rivers, lakes, and ponds, these turtles have webbed feet. The Red-Eared Slider is a popular pet in this category.</li>
            <li>Tortoises: Unlike their aquatic relatives, tortoises live on land and have sturdy legs instead of flippers. The Galápagos Tortoise, known for its massive size, is a prime example.</li>
        </ol>
